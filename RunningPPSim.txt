RUNNING PPSIM JARS FROM GITHUB

Two choices: PPSim_May13_GUI.jar runs the sim with a GUI, PPSim_May13_NoGUI.jar runs the sim with no GUI

1. Download zip file from Github
2. In your working folder, create a folder called BiologicalSimulationInstances
3. Place the contents of the Github folder BiologicalSimulationInstances into that new folder. Make sure this has the compiled classes, not the source files.
4. Make sure the jar you want to run is in your working folder, not the BiologicalSimulationInstances folder.
5. Make sure you have completed the XML parameter file correctly. Example - Aleatory_Analysis_Test.xml on Github
6. From the terminal window, type: java -jar PPSim_May13_[No]GUI.jar [FullPathToYourXMLParameterFile] [DescriptionOfThisRun (i.e. a run number]
7. Simulation results will then be stored in the result file path specified in the XML file, in a folder named with the description you stated in step 6.
